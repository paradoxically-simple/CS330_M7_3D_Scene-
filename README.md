# CS330_M7_3D_Scene- Design Decissions

  My 3D scene began with the photo of my underwater wedding, this alleviated the need to ensure I had no copyright issues using photos found online. Using a scene that I

was in had the added benefit of keeping me interested in the project as it was a personal moment for me. Choosing a shark as my main object allowed me to focus on some 

geometry that was both interesting and challenging to build with triangles. 

	Navigating my 3D scene for a user is much like swimming in the tank, moving under, over and behind the shark. I added a rock structure to the floor of the aquarium to 
  
give the space some structure and realism. Navigating around and behind the rock will allow users to explore several angles and levels of the rock structure and view the 

shark from the structure also. 

	Unfortunately, I ran into several issues the last few weeks of my build and I had to sacrifice the shape maker class I was trying to implement. I also had found some 
  
code to build a cone using an equation algorithm but implementing it fell to a lower priority as I had to troubleshoot internet and executable file issues I was 

experiencing. If I had the time to implement the classes I wanted, I would have been able to call the shape desired and move it around the scene as needed to easily add 

a front cone to the shark, modify the plane shape and create fins.
